I propose to write /The Little MemSQL Book/, an 80-page book that explains MemSQL concepts to new customers and employees so that they learn the components and have an accurate mental model of how the product works. I want to use plain language and cover topics that are often confusing to new users.

GOALS:

 * To have a free e-book that anyone can download from our web site
 * To have chapters that the documentation team can borrow
 * To have chapters that the marketing team can borrow
 * To have a paper book that we can give new and prospective customers
 * To have a paper book for sale on Amazon
 * To remain up-to-date with each major release of MemSQL (7.5, 8.0, and so on)

NON-GOALS:

 * The book will not repeat the synax of commands from our official documentation.
 * The book will not refer to older versions of MemSQL. Each release of the book will correspond to a particular release of MemSQL.

WHAT I NEED

 * Permission to include material from MemSQL documentation, training slides, and other assets in the book
 * Permission to sell the paper book on Amazon and keep the proceeds of those sales
