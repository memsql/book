# The Little SingleStore Book

*The Little SingleStore Book* will be an 80-page book that explains SingleStore concepts to new customers and employees so that they learn the components and have an accurate mental model of how the product works. It uses plain language and covers topics that are often confusing to new users.

## Goals

 * To have a free e-book that anyone can download from our web site
 * To have chapters that the documentation team can borrow
 * To have chapters that the marketing team can borrow
 * To have a paper book that we can give new and prospective customers
 * To have a paper book for sale on Amazon
 * To remain up-to-date with each major release of SingleStore (7.5, 8.0, and so on)

## Non-Goals

 * The book will not repeat the synax of commands from our official documentation.
 * The book will not refer to older versions of SingleStore. Each release of the book will correspond to a particular release of SingleStore.

## Dependencies

* Pandoc
* TexLive
